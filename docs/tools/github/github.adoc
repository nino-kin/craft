== Automatically generated release notes

You can automatically generate release notes for your GitHub releases.

Automatically generated release notes provide an automated alternative to manually writing release notes for your GitHub releases. With automatically generated release notes, you can quickly generate an overview of the contents of a release. Automatically generated release notes include a list of merged pull requests, a list of contributors to the release, and a link to a full changelog.

You can also customize your automated release notes, using labels to create custom categories to organize pull requests you want to include, and exclude certain labels and users from appearing in the output.

== SSH

If you want to use the multiple accounts, you should set up `~/.ssh/config`.

The format is as follows:

[source, text]
----
Host <host name>
HostName <host name>
User <user name>
Port <port number>
IdentityFile <ssh-key path>
----
